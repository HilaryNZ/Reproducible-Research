## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type of devices are part of the “quantified self” movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

The dataset (Activity monitoring data [52K]) used in this assignment was downloaded from the course web site: 

The variables included in this dataset are:

    *steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA\color{red}{\verb|NA|}NA)
    *date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
    *interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations.

## Install libraries
```{r}
library(plyr)
library(Hmisc)
library(tidyverse)
library(scales)
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r cars}
activity_data<-read.csv("./activity.csv")
head(activity_data)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
### Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
data <-aggregate(x = activity_data$steps,                # Specify data column
                        by = list(activity_data$date),              # Specify group indicator
                        FUN = sum, na.rm = TRUE)                            # Specify function (i.e. sum)
head(data)
```

### Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
```{r}
data_hist<- data$x
hist(data_hist,
     main="Frequency of range of steps per day",
     xlab="Total steps",
     col="blue",
     ylim = c(0,30),
)

```

### Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r}
mean_steps <- round(mean(data$x, na.rm = TRUE))
print(paste("The mean is: ", mean_steps)) 

median_steps <- round(median(data$x, na.rm = TRUE))
print(paste("The median is: ", median_steps)) 
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
interval_mean <-aggregate(x = activity_data$steps,                
                          by = list(activity_data$interval),              
                          FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)                            
head(interval_mean)
```

## Time series plot  
```{r}
interval_meanplot <- ggplot(interval_mean, aes(x=Group.1, y=x)) +
  geom_line(color="#69b3a2") + 
  xlab("Five minute intervals over 24 hour period") +
  ylab("Average Steps taken")
interval_meanplot
```

### 5 min interval with the highest step average
```{r}
interval_avg <-interval_mean[which.max(interval_mean$x),]
print(paste("The highest average number of steps for any 5 minute interval: ", interval_avg$Group.1)) 
```

## Imputing missing values

Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values. The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.  

### Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
```{r}
sapply(activity_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

### Impute with mean value
```{r}
df_imputed <- ddply(activity_data, "interval", mutate, imputed.value = impute(steps, mean))
dfIm <- df_imputed %>%
          mutate(steps1 = coalesce(steps, imputed.value))

drop_col <- c("steps","imputed.value")
new_df<-dfIm[ , !(names(dfIm) %in% drop_col)]
head(new_df)
```

### Histogram of step frequency
```{r}
new_dfIm <-aggregate(x = new_df$steps1,               
                 by = list(new_df$date),               
                 FUN = sum)                            

dfIMhist<- new_dfIm$x
head(dfIMhist)
hist(dfIMhist,
     main="Frequency of range of steps per day (Imputed data)",
     xlab="Total steps",
     col="blue",
)
```

### Mean and median number of all steps per day
```{r}
mean_steps_new_df <- round(mean(new_dfIm$x))
print(paste("The mean is: ", mean_steps_new_df)) 

median_steps_new_df <- round(median(new_dfIm$x))
print(paste("The median is: ", median_steps_new_df)) 
```
## What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Imputing the NA's values increases the mean of steps taken per day from 9354 to 10766 and the median from 10395 to 10766. Using imputed data allows for the data containing NA's to be used in the analysis, however caution should be taken as the imputed values may bias the analysis.



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
### Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r}
new_df1 <-new_df

new_df1$date <- as.Date(new_df1$date)
new_df1$day <- weekdays(new_df1$date)

new_df1$weekday_end <- ifelse(new_df1$day == c("Saturday","Sunday"), "Weekend","Weekday")

week_df <- filter(new_df1, new_df1$weekday_end == "Weekday")
head(week_df)
```
```{r}
Weekend_df <- filter(new_df1, new_df1$weekday_end == "Weekend")
head(Weekend_df)
```


### Create df for weekdays
```{r}
week_df_mean <-aggregate(x = week_df$steps1,                
                          by = list(week_df$interval),              
                          FUN = mean)                            

week_df_mean$weekday_end <- "weekday"
colnames(week_df_mean) <- c("interval", "mean_steps","Day")
head(week_df_mean)
```

### Create df for weekends
```{r}
Weekend_df_mean <-aggregate(x = Weekend_df$steps1,                
                         by = list(Weekend_df$interval),              
                         FUN = mean)                            

Weekend_df_mean$weekday_end <- "Weekend"
colnames(Weekend_df_mean) <- c("interval", "mean_steps","Day")
head(Weekend_df_mean)

```

### ### Join df's for time series plots
```{r}
joined_df <- rbind(week_df_mean, Weekend_df_mean)  #UP TO HERE
head(joined_df)
```

### Time series plots for weekdays and weekends 
```{r}
g <- ggplot (joined_df, aes (x=interval, y=mean_steps))
g + geom_line(color="steelblue") + facet_grid (Day~.) + 
  labs(y = "Mean Number of Steps") + labs(x = " 5 Minute Intervals") + 
  ggtitle("Average Number of Steps - Weekday vs. Weekend") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
